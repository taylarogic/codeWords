# this is what i did in week nine.
This week I really struggled making a start on my code for the next assessment. Nothing was working the way I wanted it to and I was feeling defeated :(. Andy and Karen ann said as long as long as we placed one brick down we would be ok. I realised I had a bunch of bricks but no cement. I had a bunch of ideas but no solid foundation for them. I decided I would have to browse [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/browse/#) for some help. 

### WEEK 9 UPDATE

OpenProcessing and other online resources stressed me out even more so I stopped. BUT I have something! I learnt how to put text on a curve and added a rotation which kinda looks maze-like which was what I was trying to achieve. I also span the word 'death' and used the random function to generate different speeds when the mouse is pressed. I found spinning the word looked like a web which I liked. I'm trying to work out how to make it a chaotic mess of jumbled words. I would like to try a typographic random walk function or dla (diffusion limited aggregation). Not really sure how to do it, managed to do it with points and lines tho. I just want words and sentences to grow and branch out. So, I'm going to keep working and trying to figure out a way to do that :).
