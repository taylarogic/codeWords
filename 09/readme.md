# this is what i did in week nine.
This week I began working on my code for the next assessment. 
I learnt how to put text on a curve and added a rotation which kinda looks maze-like which was what I was trying to achieve. I also span the word 'death' and used the random function to generate different speeds when the mouse is pressed. I found spinning the word looked like a web which I liked. I'm trying to work out how to make it a chaotic mess of jumbled words. I would like to try a typographic random walk function or dla (diffusion limited aggregation). Not really sure how to do it, managed to do it with points and lines tho.
