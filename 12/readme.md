In our final week we uploaded our final projects and got to see everyone's work which was so cool. I am so proud of my peers and what they achieved. 

## Reflection 
I've found this studio to be super valuable and fun. It's definitely been my favourite. Learning about gaming performances was so cool to me and getting the chance to create our own performances was an interesting experience, made even more enjoyable through Second Life. My group cooperated so well making this strange task feel like I was just gaming with friends. It made me think about the secondary personas and alter egos people take on when they enter these digital worlds, as we were also entering these games posing as characters from House of Leaves, who were very unike our normal selves (especially [physically](https://taylarogic.github.io/codeWords/05/secondlife.png)). The hour or so of code every Thursday with Karen was genuinely the most exciting part of my week. I loved learning something new each week, and especially enjoyed the lesson on classes. I'm so glad I took the chance to learn about code because it has become something that I really enjoy and want to expand my knowledge on. It is wonderful to see how far I've come from knowing absolutely nothing about code prior to the class. Last year I found myself in a stagnant position of not doing anything that was challenging me, and I hate feeling like I'm getting dumber (lol). This studio was the best decision I've made. It was challenging, exciting and rewarding. It has made me realise I want to learn more about this field of practice. I feel inspired again. Thanks Andy and Karen for that!
