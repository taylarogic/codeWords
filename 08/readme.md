# this is what i did in week eight. 
This week I worked on my prototype further and wrote some pseudo code. I'm finding generating ideas quite easy and exciting, however the thought of translating them into code after prototyping is quite scary. I'm not entirely sure how I'm going to achieve the ideas I have thought of, but I am excited to try. My prototype focuses on a jagged maze that moves from legible to alphabet soup. My final work almost never ends up being my original idea, as it gradually transforms into something else. I have accepted that this is likely to happen as I'm not confident with coding yet. I hope to achieve something that I'm proud of and that hopefully kind've mirrors the ideas in my paper prototypes.
