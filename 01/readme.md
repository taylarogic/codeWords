# this is what i did in week one.

We began the first lesson on a virtual walk in Minecraft Melbourne. I immediately thought this way of learning was perfect considering current circumstances. We were interacting with eachother in this digital space and it felt like the closest thing to in person relationships and communication. It was exciting having been deprived of these connections and this kind of interactivity. I could pretend I was walking around Melbourne and engaging with my class mates again which was nice.

In Minecraft Melbourne we were introduced to the idea of digital performance art and e-literature (which we will explore further later on). We started to learn the possibilities of our first brief, in which we are to explore how reading is changing in virtual environments. In groups we will interpret text through a performance in an online gaming environment. This task will introduce us to communicating theories in reading and language in digital worlds which is pretty cool.

Andy showed us [Joseph DeLappe's](http://www.delappe.net/) performance of an episode of Friends, where each player logged into the game as one the characters and recited their lines. The performers functioned as passive, neutral visitors to the game - killed and reincarnated to continue the performance. I checked out other gaming performances by him and thought they were so sick. I particularly really like [dead-in-iraq](http://www.delappe.net/project/dead-in-iraq/), a performative intervention which acted as an online memorial for military personnel who have been killed in the Iraq conflict. He used the game's text messaging system, which immediately made me think could be a great communication option when conducting my House of Leaves performance. 

We were also introduced to Processing, and learnt how to code shapes, lines and colours. I was so excited to create my first coded sketch. 
Our task for the week was to create our initials with the new skills we had learnt. I used isolated squares to form my letters, which allowed me to get used to x and y coordinates and I could also play around with changing the colour of each square by moving my mouse.
