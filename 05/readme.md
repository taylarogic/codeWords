# this is what i did in week five.

We dedicated most of our class to screening our Task 2 work. It went well. 

I really enjoyed this task. It didn’t really feel like an assignment. I believe Second Life was a great choice to interpret the text, as the game is innately weird and scary. Often at times I felt like I was in a fever dream. The inability to create and build our scenes meant we spent a lot of time trying to find the right locations. We could however alter our avatars which I’m not sure exactly helped us give an accurate visualisation of the story, but it was fun emphasising my character Karen’s descriptive features. Camera controls and lighting were our biggest blessing.
