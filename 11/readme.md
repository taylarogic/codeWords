# this is what i did in week eleven. 

By spending this week playing and experimenting rather than looking online at super advanced work and wondering 'how can I do something like that?,' I ended up achieving the idea I had from my prototype (jagged growing maze of words)!! Which I basically gave up on weeks ago because it was causing me to become manic and I was so stressed about it that I was even coding in my dreams- YES I was dreaming about my sketches (more like having nightmares). I just removed the background which caused my text variable to produce multiple random strings of these words, which created an overwhelming amount that overlapped and covered the screen. I am happy I adopted a new positive attitude, and returned to my design process of experimentation as happy accidents happened. I've realised and believe that my sketches aren't written well or efficiently. But they work the way I want at least? I think experimentation involves doing things deemed impractical or risky yet some pretty cool outcomes can come out of it so I think I'm ok with not having the prettiest, most sensical sketch.

I emailed Andy for advice as I was concerned about making dramatic changes to my code not long before it was due. Andy said 'The key to getting it right is to respect a process, reflect on the work at the different stages of this process, rather than thinking that you need to find the perfect “solution” to a problem within a given period of time.' 

I have accepted that my final work isn't something that I will have perfected or be 100% happy with, but it'll be something that I am able to feel very proud of.
