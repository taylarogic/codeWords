# this is what i did in week two. 

We discussed and researched modular typeface designs, from the Bauhuas to contemporary designers working in algorithmic typography.

I personally enjoyed the work of [Jurriaan Schrofer](https://typejournal.ru/en/articles/Jurriaan-Schrofer), and how he transforms typography into imagery, through patterns and manipulation. 


We also made further progress on our assignment where we were tasked with reinterpreting a portion of the novel House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski in a virtual gaming world. My group made the decision to reenact our passages in Second Life. I have never played Second Life before, which is primarily why I chose it. I also know of it to be weird and kinda cursed which intrigued me.

More learning on Processing was done, with experimentation with spirographs, which has further inspired me to play with code outside of class. We also were introduced to Github and created our first repository which will form our SKO.
