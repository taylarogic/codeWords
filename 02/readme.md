# this is what i did in week two. 

We discussed, researched and shared modular typeface designs, from the Bauhuas to contemporary designers working in algorithmic typography. [These are our findings!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N2hAFp6si7UsVuPj1oMQ21_HHF858NbXZna0YQxOQio/edit#slide=id.g8ed135ac50_10_0)

I personally really enjoyed the work of [Jurriaan Schrofer](https://typejournal.ru/en/articles/Jurriaan-Schrofer), and how he transforms typography into rythmic compositions and imagery, through patterns and manipulation. 

We also made further progress on our assignment where we were tasked with reinterpreting a portion of the novel House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski in a virtual gaming world. No one wanted to do chess with me, so I settled on Second Life. I have never played Second Life before, which is primarily why I chose it. I also know of it to be weird and kinda cursed which intrigued me.

We were shown [Stelarc's Second Life installation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSsmjcl-BjA&ab_channel=ClintonGreen) to inspire decisions around creating our avatars. And like his disturbing ear implant, I found it quite enjoyable. 

More learning on Processing was done, with experimentation with spirographs, which has further inspired me to play with code outside of class. We also were introduced to Github and created our first repository which will form our SKO. Github is very unfamiliar to me but I think I kinda get it. In time I'm sure I'll be ok.
