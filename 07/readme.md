# this is what i did in week seven. 
Over the semester break I played around with coding mathematical roses and also some other fun stuff. In this week I explored code as an inventive and exploratory practise, involving happy accidents and problem solving that results in interesting and surprising design outcomes. Some of these include expected and unexpected shapes, patterns, symmetry, asymmetry, repetition, tiling, etc. 

I also prototyped my project. With reference to the analogy of black metal logos resembling a maze, I decided to draw the word 'death' in a maze as the text mentions it would be essential for metal bands to feature that word.
