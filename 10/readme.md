# this is what i did in week 10

This week I incorporated sound into my sketch among other small refinements and additions. I found that looking at inspiration online made me feel worse, as it generated more ideas in my head that I had no idea how to do. And the more I played a sketch and saw a blank screen the more discouraged and sad I got. So I've stopped looking at references and such online and I am now dedicating the coming week to playing around and doing my own thing.
