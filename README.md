# codeWords
## hello ( ͡▀̿ ̿ ͜ʖ ͡▀̿ ̿)

This is my Studio Knowledge Object for CodeWords! Welcome! Here I document my occasional breakdown while coding and also talk about things I find really cool. This is a space for me to archive everything I have learnt in the wonderful Code Words class. I reflect and talk about my experiences coding for the first time and my thoughts on some really sick topics like e-literature and gaming performances. Studio leads Andy Simionato and Karen ann Donnachie introduce us to an enlightening field of practice, filled with coding lessons, inspiring discussions and collaborative fun. Through this repo, I am able to revisit my progress and feel proud of my learning growth and also realise I not only gained knowledge on p5js and creative coding, but also learnt more about myself and my design process. It has been equally amazing following the progress of my fellow peers and watching them grow and develop some fantastic work. CodeWords rules! Follow Tayla's trajectory week by week through the links. I have updated them weekly, provided emotional anecdotes, images and external links. You can navigate through each week at the bottom of the page.
