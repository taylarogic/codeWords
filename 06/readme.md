# this is what i did in week six.

We chose which critical theory/text we would like to base our major project on. I chose Blackletter and Black Metal as the concept of illegibility as code excited me. The encoding and encryption of the intricate, maze-like type, as opposed to clear communication is a narrative I'd like to translate in my project.

Karen ann also demonstrated how to code larger blocks of texts.
